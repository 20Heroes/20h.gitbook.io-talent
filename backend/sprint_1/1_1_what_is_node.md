# What is node

**Node.js** is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software 'Open-source software'), [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform 'Cross-platform') [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript 'JavaScript') [run-time environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system 'Runtime system') that executes JavaScript code [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side 'Server-side'). Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for [client-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting 'Client-side scripting'), in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for [server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting 'Server-side scripting')â€”running scripts server-side to produce [dynamic web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page 'Dynamic web page') content _before_ the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application 'Web application') development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
